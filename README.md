# Machine-Learning-Recipes
Machine Learning Recipes is a [series of introductory videos](https://goo.gl/KewA03) covering codes and insights about ML with python and opensource libraries (TensorFlow and Scikit-learn).

## #1 Hello World
Six lines of Python is all it takes to write a simple machine learning program. We will collect some simple data and with a decision tree, predict wheter an input represents an orange or an apple, by its weight and texture.

## #2 Visualizing a Decision Tree
We'll build a decision tree on a real dataset, add code to visualize it, and practice reading it.

## #3 What Makes a Good Feature? 
Good features are informative, independent, and simple. These concepts will be introduced by using a histogram to visualize a feature from a toy dataset. There are other great examples of histograms codes, that you can find here:

## #4 Writing a pipeline
We use the Iris data set again, but with another classifier, the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Using the model_selection we can randomly select the train data from the Iris data set, and try to predict the rest of the samples. At the end we will measure the accuracy of both classifiers.

## #5 Writing our first classifier

In order to really understand what is behind a classifier, we will build our own, base on the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). At the end, we compare the accuracy of a random prediction, our classifier KNN, and the KNN from the library.
